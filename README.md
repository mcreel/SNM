# SNM

This archive contains the code for the examples reported in the working paper "Inference
Using Simulated Neural Moments". The most recent version of the WP is here in the archive,
the file SNM.pdf.

There is a registered Julia package "SimulatedNeuralMoments" which allows convenient use of the methods. The code in the master branch of this archive uses this package for the examples.

Here's the abstract of the paper:

Here are 95% confidence interval coverage results for the test models.

Stochastic volatility and ARMA models:
