# SNM

This archive contains the code for the examples reported in the working paper "Inference Using Simulated Neural Moments". The most recent version of the WP is here in the archive, the file SNM.pdf. The master branch of the archive has the code used in this latest version. 

There is a registered Julia package "SimulatedNeuralMoments" which allows convenient use of the methods. The code in the master branch of this archive uses this package for the examples.
