This directory holds an example of estimation of the jump diffusion model

using data on S&P500 returns from Dec. 2013 - Dec. 2017. The returns data is pictured in

Log price, p, is assumed to be measured with a N(0,\tau^2) error. The results are in the .png files. For example, for the parameter tau, the marginal posterior is in the following figure. We see that there is strong evidence in favor of measurement error being a factor.
